    "# ---->\n",
    "# A database is a collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient storage, \n",
    "# retrieval, and management of the data. In computing, databases are used to store and manage large \n",
    "# amounts of data in a structured manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL Databases:\n",
    "# SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on the relational model and are used to store data in \n",
    "# tables with pre-defined relationships between the tables. SQL databases are organized using a schema, \n",
    "# which defines the structure of the data and the relationships between different tables. SQL databases are \n",
    "# best suited for applications that require complex querying and reporting, as well as for applications that\n",
    "# need to enforce strict data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "# NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are designed to store unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "# They do not have a pre-defined schema and can store data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, \n",
    "# documents, or graphs. NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which means they can handle large \n",
    "# amounts of data and traffic by adding more servers to the cluster. NoSQL databases are best suited for \n",
    "# applications that require high scalability and availability, such as social media platforms, e-commerce \n",
    "# websites, and real-time data analytics."

    "# TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to delete all the data from an existing table, but keep the\n",
