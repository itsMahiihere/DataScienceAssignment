    "# Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write difference between Exception and Syntax Error?\n",
    "# ---->\n",
    "# In Python, an Exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program.\n",
    "# Exceptions are raised when something goes wrong in the program, such as an invalid input, a division by zero,\n",
    "# or a file that cannot be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When an exception occurs, Python raises an object of the corresponding exception class, which includes information about the \n",
    "# type of error and where it occurred in the code.\n",
    "# If an exception is not caught and handled by the program, it will cause the program to terminate and display an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To catch and handle exceptions in Python, you can use a try-except block. \n",
    "# This allows you to write code that will try to execute a block of code, and if an exception occurs, \n",
    "# it will be caught by the except block and handled accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Both exceptions and syntax errors are types of errors that can occur in Python, but they are different in nature.\n",
    " # Syntax errors ---->\n",
    "# Syntax errors occur when the interpreter is unable to parse the code due to a violation of the language syntax rules.\n",
    "# This means that the code does not follow the correct structure and format required by the Python language, and the interpreter \n",
    "# is unable to understand and execute it. Examples of syntax errors include missing or incorrect parentheses, colons, or commas,\n",
    "# misspelled keywords, and invalid indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exceptions, on the other hand, occur when the code is syntactically correct, but an error occurs during the execution of \n",
    "# the program. This can happen due to a wide range of reasons, such as invalid input, division by zero, or attempting to access \n",
    "# a non-existent object."
