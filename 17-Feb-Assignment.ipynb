    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "# MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. \n",
    "# It is designed to be highly scalable, performant, and flexible, making it an ideal choice for many modern \n",
    "# web and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional \n",
    "# table-based relational database model. Instead, they store data in a variety of ways, such as key-value \n",
    "# pairs, documents, or graphs. They offer greater flexibility and scalability than traditional relational \n",
    "# databases and are often used for big data and real-time web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# There are several scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# First, MongoDB is often used in applications that require high levels of scalability, as it allows for easy \n",
    "# horizontal scaling through sharding. This means that as the amount of data grows, MongoDB can distribute \n",
    "# the load across multiple servers, ensuring that performance remains consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Second, MongoDB is a good choice for applications that require flexible and dynamic data models. Because \n",
    "# MongoDB uses a document-based data model, it can easily handle data with varying fields and structures, \n",
    "# making it easier to store and retrieve complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Third, MongoDB is often used in applications that need to handle large amounts of unstructured data,\n",
    "# such as social media feeds or logs. Because MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, it can easily \n",
    "# handle data that does not fit into a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finally, MongoDB is a popular choice for agile development teams because it allows for quick iterations \n",
    "# and changes to data models without requiring schema migrations or downtime."

    "# MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers several features that make it a powerful tool for \n",

    "#     MongoDB uses a flexible and scalable document-based data model that allows\n",

    "\n",
    "# Ad hoc queries: \n",
    "#     MongoDB has a powerful query language that supports ad hoc queries, making it easy to\n",
    "# retrieve data in real-time without the need for predefined schemas or complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Indexing: \n",
    "#     MongoDB supports indexing on any field or subfield, making it easy to retrieve data quickly\n",
    "# and efficiently. It also supports text search, geospatial indexing, and other advanced indexing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Aggregation framework: MongoDB has a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex data processing, including filtering, grouping, sorting, and other advanced analytics features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Automatic failover and replication: \n",
    "#     MongoDB supports automatic failover and replication, making it easy to \n",
    "# ensure high availability and data consistency in the event of a node failure.\n",
